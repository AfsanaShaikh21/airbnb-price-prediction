## 🧠 Steps Performed
1. Data Loading and Cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Selection  
4. Linear Regression Model  
5. Model Evaluation (MAE, RMSE, R²)

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- scikit-learn

## 📈 Results
- Linear Regression R² ≈ (0.33)  
- Visualized trends in price vs bedrooms, bathrooms, and location

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add room type & amenities as features  
- Try advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Hyperparameter tuning
